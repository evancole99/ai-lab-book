    "## Using APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will use Yahoo Finance's API to download stock data and insert it into our investment tracking database, upon which we can do additional calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only table in the database that we are concerned with for this lesson is the _stock_ table. However, there are many more tables to play around with, allowing for more complex programs and queries. For a more detailed overview of the database, watch the video embedded below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stock table: Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an overview of the schema of the stock table.\n",
    "Note: The database is updated often, so it is possible this schema is out of date.  You can check the current schema by running the _.schema table_ command in sqlite3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Stock:\n",
    "* **ticker** varchar(5)\n",
    "    * The stock's ticker symbol, as listed on the stock exchange. Up to 5 characters.\n",
    "* **mkt**\\_**date** varchar(10)\n",
    "    * Date in YYYY-MM-DD format.\n",
    "* **open** float(16)\n",
    "    * Price per share at market open.\n",
    "* **high** float(16)\n",
    "    * Highest price during trading hours.\n",
    "* **low** float(16)\n",
    "    * Lowest price during trading hours.\n",
    "* **close** float(16)\n",
    "    * Price per share at market close.\n",
    "* **adj**\\_**close** float(16)\n",
    "    * The stock's adjusted closing price, factoring in other actions after close. Considered to be more accurate.\n",
    "* **volume** int\n",
    "    * Number of shares traded during trading hours.  \n",

    "\n",
    "First of all, we have to import all of the necessary libraries. We will be using pandas, pandas datareader, datetime, yfinance, and sqlite3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, as usual, we connect to the database using sqlite3."
