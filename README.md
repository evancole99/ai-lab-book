# AI Lab Workshops
This repository contains lessons for the URI AI Lab workshops on topics relating to data science.  

This is forked from the original repository, which may contain recent changes not reflected in this repository.  
To visit it, [click here](https://github.com/uri-ai-lab/ai-lab-book).  

The workshop content is presented in Jupyter Book, a framework for building books and documents using Markdown.  
This allows you the inclusion of executable code blocks and outputs, since Jupyter is able to execute the code when the book is compiled into HTML format.  

For more information and documentation on Jupyter, visit [their website](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).
